# amFOSS-tasks

INTRODUCTION

Hi there Im Advaith Nair, I am a first-year BTech Artifical Intelligence and Data Science undergrad at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri campus. I am beginner-level coder and my preferred language is Python. My hobbies inclube playing basketball and gaming.

Why should we choose you?

I'm genuinely excited about learning and growing within the open-source community, and I believe amFOSS is the perfect place for that. I'm someone who picks things up quickly, enjoys working in a team, and isn’t afraid to step out of my comfort zone. I value being consistent, staying curious, and collaborating with others — and these are qualities I hope to bring into the club. While I'm still learning, I'm committed to the process. I’m not afraid to ask questions, stick with tough problems, and keep improving along the way.

How do you intend to contribute back to the club?

To give back to the club, I plan to start by being an active and involved member — helping out with ongoing projects, contributing to documentation, and supporting fellow members whenever I can. As I gain more experience, I’d love to take on bigger responsibilities, like maintaining projects, mentoring juniors, and representing amFOSS in programs like GSoC or Hacktoberfest. I also want to make the journey easier for new members by sharing the lessons and resources I pick up along the way.

What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?

I’m especially interested in areas like [choose 1–2: web development, AI/ML, app development, etc.], and I’m really looking forward to building a strong foundation through hands-on experience. I want to work on real open-source projects, follow structured learning paths, and start building some of my own tools along the way. More than just learning the tech, I’m excited to explore how these skills can be used to solve real-world problems, especially by collaborating and learning from others in the community.
